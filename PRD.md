# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the phased development of a credit card rewards analysis and optimization tool. Phase 1 introduces a feature that provides users with an overview of their credit card rewards utilization, enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) to offer insights and tips for maximizing benefits. Phase 2 builds on this by incorporating multi-card optimization and detailed recommendations for optimizing spending, leveraging the LLM to provide highly tailored suggestions.

### 1.2 Background
Credit card users often underutilize the full range of rewards and benefits available to them. This product addresses that gap by providing users with clear insights into their credit card performance. Phase 1 focuses on a single-card analysis enhanced by LLM insights. Phase 2 expands to multi-card optimization, empowering users to make more informed decisions about their spending across multiple cards.

### 1.3 Objectives
#### Phase 1 Objectives:
- Provide users with a summary of rewards utilization (points earned, benefits redeemed, and statement credits received).
- Integrate an LLM to:
  - Generate an easy-to-understand overview of the user's rewards and benefits utilization.
  - Offer actionable tips for maximizing membership benefits that have not been fully utilized.

#### Phase 2 Objectives:
- Extend rewards analysis to multi-card optimization.
- Integrate the LLM to:
  - Provide recommendations on how to optimize spending between cards.
  - Identify recurring or frequent transactions (e.g., gas, groceries) and recommend optimal card placement.
  - Offer insights on how users can maximize value across multiple cards.
